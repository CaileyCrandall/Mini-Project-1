# Mini-Project-1


# Employee Satisfaction

## Introduction
We wanted to look into employee productivity and the various factors encompassed. We are creating a decision tree on employee attrition, a neural network on predicted job satisfaction, and a clustering model on work projects completed. 

## Data Source
Two datasets were found from Kaggle and cleaned and merged into one. To merge the data, a mutual column was created in both data sets and they were merged within that column. Evaluation of the models will be done with a confusion matrix.

## Installation and Setup
Instructions for setting up the project environment and running the code:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   

## Data Processing
Explain how the data was processed and any preprocessing steps taken before analysis.

## Analysis and Discussion
Provide an overview of the methods used for analysis. Include key findings, interpretations, and any challenges encountered.

## Results
Summarize the results with supporting visuals, tables, or explanations.
